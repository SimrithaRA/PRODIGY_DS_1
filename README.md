# Real Estate Data Analysis with Python

This repository contains Python code for analyzing real estate data using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The code loads a dataset from a CSV file and creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of house prices per unit area.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you'll need the following software installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.0 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook or an IDE of your choice
- Required Python libraries: Pandas and Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd real-estate-analysis
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your real estate data in a CSV file and save it in the project directory. Ensure that the CSV file has a column named "Y house price of unit area."
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or your preferred IDE and run the `real_estate_analysis.ipynb` file.
3. The code will load the dataset, create a histogram, and display it in your IDE.
4. Customize the plot as needed by adjusting the number of bins, axis labels, and title.
